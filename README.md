# node-mongo-crud

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kottapar/node-mongo-crud.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kottapar/node-mongo-crud)

A CRUD API built with MongoDB and Express. This project is forked to help with the below TravisCI pipeline.

The intention is to build a pipeline for a NodeJS web app that performs the unit tests and a security scan of the code before building the Docker image and pushing it a repo.

## Code scan using NodeJSScan

The open-source project [nodejssscan](https://github.com/ajinabraham/NodeJsScan)
